      Sample-accurate ramp / grain / timing object
  </digest>
  <description>
      <o>voicedrive~</o> is a (sub)sample-accurate (usually non-interrupting) ramp generator with several useful outputs for driving grains, playback voices or other similar processes. Typically <o>voicedrive~</o> is used in connection with the <o>voicemanager~</o> object, as the drive unit for each individual voice of a process. Because <o>voicedrive~</o> is a non-interrupting (in default mode) it can also be used for other sample-accurate timing purposes such as random length ramping (for interpolation between values for example).

            The first outlet outputs a linear ramp <m>signal</m> to indicate a playback position in milliseconds.
            <br />
            The second outlet outputs a normalised ramp <m>signal</m> (0-1).
            <br />
            The third outlet outputs a <m>signal </m> trigger at the beginning of each ramp.
            <br />
            The fourth outlet outputs the busy flag.
