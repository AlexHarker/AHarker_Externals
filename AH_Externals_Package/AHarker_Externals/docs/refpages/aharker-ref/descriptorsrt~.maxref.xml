  <description>
      <o>descriptorsrt~</o> can be used to calculate a large number of audio descriptors (or features) in real-time from an incoming signal The results are output as a list. <o>descriptorsrt~</o> is intended as a comprehensive real-time analysis solution, being suitable for a wide range of tracking / following / detection applications. It is the real-time counterpart to the <o>descriptors~</o> object - the two objects are very similar in terms of features and usage. <o>descriptorsrt~</o> only calculates and outputs the descriptors that the user requests (these can be changed in realtime). It is designed to be as efficient as possible, avoiding unnecessary calculations and re-calculations wherever possible and making extensive use of SIMD operations.
