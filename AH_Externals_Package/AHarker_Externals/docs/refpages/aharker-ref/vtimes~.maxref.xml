        A SIMD version of times~
    </digest>
  <description>
      <o>vtimes~</o> provides a CPU efficient version of <o>times~</o> using SIMD operations. 
      <br/>
      <o>vtimes~</o> is a signal multiplier-operator that outputs a signal which is the multiplication between two signals.

              Sets an initial value by which to multiply the signal coming into the left inlet. If a signal is connected to the right inlet, the argument is ignored. If no argument is present, and no signal is connected to the right inlet, the initial value is <m>0</m> by default.

              In left inlet: The signal is multiplied by the signal coming into the right inlet, or a constant value received in the right inlet. All signal inputs to a single inlet are summed. If a signal and number are both sent to the left inlet, the specified operation will be performed with those values.
