      Calculate and analyse audio descriptors (features) from a buffer
  </digest>
  <description>
      The <o>descriptors~</o> object can be used to calculate a large number of audio descriptors (or features) from a sample stored in an MSP <o>buffer~</o> (or an <o>ibuffer~</o> object). Various statistical calculations may be performed on the resultant descriptors (mean / median / standard deviation / max n values etc.) to produce useful information about the sample. <o>descriptors~</o> is intended as a comprehensive analysis solution, and is the non real-time counterpart to the <o>descriptorsrt~</o> object - the two objects are very similar in terms of features and usage. <o>descriptors~</o> only calculates and outputs the descriptors that the user requests, and can also operate on subsections of a <o>buffer~</o> / <o>ibuffer~</o>. It is designed to be as efficient as possible, avoiding unnecessary calculations and re-calculations wherever possible and making extensive use of SIMD operations.
