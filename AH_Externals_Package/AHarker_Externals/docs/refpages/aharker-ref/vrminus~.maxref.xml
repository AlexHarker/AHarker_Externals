        A SIMD version of rminus~
    </digest>
  <description>
      <o>vrminus~</o> provides a CPU efficient version of <o>rminus~</o> using SIMD operations. 
      <br/>
      The <o>vrminus~</o> object functions just like the <o>vminus~</o> object, but the inlet order is reversed.

              Initial subtraction value
          </digest>
          <description>
              Sets an initial amount to subtract from the signal coming into the right inlet. If a signal is only connected to the left inlet, that value is subtracted from the given argument. If a signal is connected to both the left and right inlets, the argument is overridden by the signal coming into the right inlet. If no argument is present, the initial value is <m>0</m> by default.

              In left inlet: The signal is subtracted from the signal coming into the right inlet, or a constant value received in the right inlet. All signal inputs to a single inlet are summed. If a signal and number are both sent to the left inlet, the specified operation will be performed with those values.
