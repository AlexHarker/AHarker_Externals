Building using Provided Projects
---------

This repositiory uses submodules.
Make sure these are correctly cloned/updated before trying to build.
Should you wish to build the externals yourself you will require the following:

**Mac:**
1. Xcode

*Notes*

* AVX / SSE support can also be toggled in projects/ah_projects_config/config_mac.xcconfig (for old machines, or Rosetta 2 support).

**Windows:**
1. Visual Studio
2. OneMKL - https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onemkl-download.html

Building using CMake
---------

Alternatively you can generate projects and build via cmake by following the commands below (requires cmake in addition to the above, and python on windows for the MKL installation):

**Mac:**

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -GXcode
cmake --build . --config Release
```

**Windows:**

In this case OneMKL is installed via a python script (rather than the installer above)

```sh
mkdir build (or New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path build) # use the latter if in  Powershell
python source/scripts/install_mkl.py # once to install mkl
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```
With thanks to shakfu (https://github.com/shakfu) for providing cmake support
