A brief overview of some areas addressed:

* general purpose scaling for Max and MSP
* efficient partitioned + non- partitioned convolution
* comprehensive descriptor analysis (realtime + non-realtime)
* enhanced audio multi-threading / dynamic patch loading
* efficient buffer playback and storage
* high quality random number generators for Max and MSP
* sample accurate voice management and more
* thread debugging and switching
* utility objects
* SIMD versions of 35 basic MSP objects

The current versions support Max and Windows in 64bit, including support for Apple ARM (M1) processors.

The AHarker Externals are licensed under a the 3-clause BSD license.

Portions of this work have been supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and the HISSTools Project at the University of Huddersfield.

Package Releases / Binaries
---------

- At this time alpha releases are available via GitHub releases. 
- Until official release some objects may change. 
- Please report any issues with the issues page on GitHub. 

Compiling
---------

Should you wish to compile the externals yourself you will require the following:

**Mac:**
1. Xcode
2. The max-sdk-base repository (https://github.com/Cycling74/max-sdk-base)

*Notes*

* The max-sdk-base repository main folder should be located next to (in the same enclosing folder as) the main folder for this repository.
* The location for the max-sdk-base can be modified in Config_AHarker_Externals.xcconfig if desired.
* AVX / SSE support can also be toggled in Config_AHarker_Externals.xcconfig (for old machines, or Rosetta 2 support).

**Windows:**
1. Visual Studio
2. OneMKL or OneAPI Base Toolkit (which includes OneMKL)
    - https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onemkl-download.html
    - https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/base-toolkit-download.html
3. The max-sdk-base repository (https://github.com/Cycling74/max-sdk-base)

*Notes*

* The OneMKL installation needs to include Visual Studio integration (this is required for some of the externals using SIMD)
* The max-sdk-base repository main folder should be located next to (in the same enclosing folder as) the main folder for this repository.
* The location for the max-sdk-base can be modified in AH_Win_Debug.props / AH_Win_Release.props if desired.

Enjoy,

Alex Harker
