A brief overview of some areas addressed:

* general purpose scaling for Max and MSP
* efficient partitioned + non- partitioned convolution
* comprehensive descriptor analysis (realtime + non-realtime)
* enhanced audio multi-threading / dynamic patch loading
* efficient buffer playback and storage
* high quality random number generators for Max and MSP
* sample accurate voice management and more
* thread debugging and switching
* utility objects
* SIMD versions of 35 basic MSP objects

The AHarker Externals are licensed freely for non-commercial use (see \_Docs\_License\_ for details of the specifics of licensing for particular objects). At this time it is not possible to license in a less restrictive way due to some current dependencies. I intend to remove these dependencies for the next major release.

Portions of this work have been supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and the HISSTools Project at the University of Huddersfield.

Enjoy,
