        A SIMD version of rdiv~
    </digest>
  <description>
      <o>vrdiv~</o> provides a CPU efficient version of <o>rdiv~</o> using SIMD operations.
      <br/>
      The <o>vrdiv~</o> object functions just like the <o>/~</o> object, but the inlet order is reversed.

              Sets an initial value by which to divide the signal coming into the left inlet. If a signal is connected to the right inlet, the argument is ignored. If no argument is present, and no signal is connected to the right inlet, the initial value is <m>1</m> by default.

              In left inlet: The signal is used as the divisor, to be divided into the signal coming into the right inlet, or the constant value received in the right inlet. All signal inputs to a single inlet are summed. If a signal and number are both sent to the left inlet, the specified operation will be performed with those values.
