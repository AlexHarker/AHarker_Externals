      Sample-accurate voice management
  </digest>
  <description>
      <o>voicemanager~</o> is a (sub)sample-accurate voice manager for use with the <o>voicedrive~</o> object. Typically <o>voicemanager~</o> is located outside of a <o>poly~</o> (or <o>dynamicdsp~</o>) object within which the <o>voicedrive~</o> objects are hosted (in each voice). The trigger input causes a voice to be assigned with the given length and offset (which must be known before the voice starts). The object keeps track of which voices are free at any one time, assuming the incoming data is passed on correctly to each voice. Outgoing triggers are then numbered according to voice, and can be tested using an audio rate comparison to derive triggers for individual voices.

              In the first inlet: A trigger <m>signal</m>. This causes an output numbered with a free voice from the first outlet.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              In the second inlet: A <m>signal</m> to determine the length (in milliseconds) to send out of the second outlet. This can then be used for the length input of <o>voicedrive~</o>.
              <br/>
              The input value is sampled when a trigger is recieved in the first inlet.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The the third inlet: A <m>signal</m> input sets the subsample offset.
              <br/>
              The subsample offset is for many applications not necessary. However, if for some reason you need better than sample-accurate timing (for pitched prcoesses et.) you can utilise this functionality.
              <br/>
              It works by pre-advancing the ramps by the given subsample offset (between 0 and 1). The logic behind this is that for detection process, detection can only happen after the event (in this case crossing the 0 or 1 point) has taken place. Thus, the trigger occurs late by a fraction of a sample. To compensate for this, we advance the ramps by that amount to acheive subsample accuracy. Offset is applied to both the normalised and position ramps of <o>voicedrive~</o> and <o>voicemanager~</o> also takes account of the subsample offset.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              In the fourth inlet: A <m>signal</m> to determine the number of active voices being processed by <o>voicemanager~</o>. This overrides the number of voices argument.

              The <m>active</m> appended with an int sets the number of active voices. being processed by <o>voicemanager~</o>. This overrides the number of voices argument.
