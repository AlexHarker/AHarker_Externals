        A SIMD version of minus~
    </digest>
  <description>
      <o>vminus~</o> provides a CPU efficient version of <o>minus~</o> using SIMD operations. 
      <br/>
      Use the <o>vminus~</o> object to perform signal subtraction (to output a signal which is the difference between two signals).

              Initial subtraction value
          </digest>
          <description>
              Sets an initial amount to subtract from the signal coming into the left inlet. If a signal is connected to the right inlet, the argument is overidden. If no argument is present, and no signal is connected to the right inlet, the initial value is <m>0</m> by default.

              In left inlet: The signal coming into the right inlet or a constant value received in the right inlet is subtracted from this signal. All signal inputs to a single inlet are summed. If a signal and number are both sent to the left inlet, the specified operation will be performed with those values.
